# üåü Dynamic Storytelling with Pollinations Generative React Hooks & Components

This project demonstrates how to create dynamic storytelling experiences using [Pollinations Generative React Hooks & Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pollinations/react) in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) environment. By integrating with the [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) API, this example showcases how to generate text, images, and more, all from user prompts‚Äîunlocking a wide range of generative content creation.

## üß© Pollinations Generative React Hooks & Components

Harness the power of Pollinations.ai to easily generate dynamic content. Below are examples of key components from the `@pollinations/react` library:

### `PollinationsText`

Generate and display text based on a given prompt and seed using the Pollinations API.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PollinationsText } from '@pollinations/react';

const TermsAndConditions = () => (
  <PollinationsText seed={42}>
    Write out Pollinations.AI terms and conditions in Chinese.
  </PollinationsText>
);

export default TermsAndConditions;
```

### `PollinationsMarkdown`

Render markdown content dynamically based on a prompt.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PollinationsMarkdown } from '@pollinations/react';

const AdSlogan = () => (
  <PollinationsMarkdown seed={42}>
    Create a cool advertising slogan about Pollinations in markdown.
  </PollinationsMarkdown>
);

export default AdSlogan;
```

### `PollinationsImage`

Generate and display an image from a text prompt and seed.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PollinationsImage } from '@pollinations/react';

const SunsetImage = () => (
  <PollinationsImage prompt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean" width={800} height={600} seed={42} />
);

export default SunsetImage;
```
